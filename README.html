<h1>MPD Architecture & Simple C Server-Client Program for VLC command parsing</h1>
<p>This repository contains supplement files for the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HHBeUhZwo73mbgj_cNPHwifbSYW9LP9x_NRQUlRTvKY/edit?usp=sharing"> VLC MPD Server Proposal</a>.</p>

<h3>Code - C/C++ Files</h3>
<p>
    <li>
        <a href="./server-client/">Server-Client Folder</a> contains a simple socket programme for Client and Socket in C language.
        At this time, we can send and recive basic commands like <code>vlc</code>, <code>vlc --version</code>, <code>vlc --help</code> from client, and it would be parsed and executed
        in server.

        <a href="./shell_access/">Shell Access Folder</a> contains a simple C++ programme to access shell from a C++ file, in Ubuntu.

<h3>MPD Architecture</h3>

<h4>Summary Of Proposed Tasks which are to be performed during the Summer</h4>

<p>
<li>1. Creating a basic MPD server-client architecture</li>
<li>2. Implementing the MPD Protocols</li>
<li>3. Parsing Client Side Request</li>
<li>4. Connecting it with VLC media library</li>
<li>5. Implementing Different MPD features</li>
<li>6. Configuring Files Option</li>
<li>7. Command line Access to the server</li>
<li>8. Documentation & Bug Fixes</li>
</p>

<h4>Basic Flow of Command while accessing VLC MPD Server Module</h4>

<p>
<li>Step 1: Install VLC on your system, and along with this, the mpd module will also be installed.</li>
<li>Step 2: using a cmd line argument, initialise the MPD server (eg. vlc --mpd or something like this)</li>
<li>Step 3: Configure the MPD server using config file, putting correct paths, music directory, etc.</li>
<li>Step 4: Run the thread in the system, it should be running in the background, waiting for requests to come, and handle it.</li>
<p>Starting the MPD Server</p>

<li>Step 5: Using mpc-clients, send requests to the server.</li>
<li>Step 6: With due command processing, actions would take place, like play, pause, random, etc.</li>
<li>Step 7: Stop the server to kill the thread.</li>
